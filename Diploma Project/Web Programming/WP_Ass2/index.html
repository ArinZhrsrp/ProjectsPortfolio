		<p>With the development of modern technology, Internet offers people more and more convenience. With the help of the Internet, people can do a lot of things without going out, like paying bills, watching movies, study online and so on. Among those, the most attractive one for people is doing shopping online. Online shopping does have many advantages but everything has two sides, some people think that it also has many disadvantages.

		<p>Online shopping attracts people because it has many advantages. Nowadays, more and more people, especially for the office worker, don’t have that much free time to go shopping they’re busy working, studying and doing other important things. So online shopping becomes the most convenient and best way for the office worker. Many people choose shopping online also because they can’t stand that crowded and noisy environment. For shopping online, they just need to choose the article they want and pay online, and then shopping is finished. To most people, shopping is not a hard and anguished job anymore, they can just stay at home, click the mouse, spend several minutes to get what they want without stepping out of the room or standing in line for checking.</p>

		<p>Well doing shopping online is not always a perfect thing, it also has disadvantages. It seems easy and quick, but there’s always a trap online. If you are careless, it will bring you some troubles. For example, if you order a cloth online, at the moment you get the item, you may find that the color is different from what you saw online, or the size is either too small or too big because it is not available to try on before ordering, or the material of the cloth is not what you want. </p>

		<p>We also provide solution to the disdvantage where customer will be able to meet the seller and confirm the order.Only after the final confirmation of the order,then only the seller will be able to receive the money.This will prevent customer and seller from getting cheated resulting both parties to be happy with the bargain made.</p>
